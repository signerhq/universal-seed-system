## Security Model

> Traditional seed phrases (BIP-39) use a single word per position from a fixed list in one language.
> A seed written on paper is immediately recognizable and usable by anyone who finds it.

The Universal Seed System takes a fundamentally different approach:

| | Traditional (BIP-39) | Universal Seed System |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Words per position | 1 | **Multiple** (synonyms, slang, abbreviations) |
| Languages | 10 | **42** |
| Visual recovery | :x: | :white_check_mark: **Select icons directly** |
| Checksum | 4–8 bit | :white_check_mark: **16-bit** |
| Paper backup recognizable as crypto? | :warning: Yes | :shield: **No** — looks like random notes |
| Mixed-language backup | :x: | :white_check_mark: Write in any combination |
| Accent/diacritic flexible | :x: | :white_check_mark: `corazón` = `corazon` |
| Emoji input | :x: | :white_check_mark: Paste :dog2: :sunny: :key: directly |
| Key stretching | PBKDF2 | **PBKDF2 + Argon2id** (chained, defense in depth) |
| Passphrase support | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: **Second factor** — same seed + different passphrase = unrelated keys |
| Multiple accounts per seed | :x: One seed = one wallet | :white_check_mark: **Unlimited hidden profiles** — one seed, many accounts |

<br>

## How It Works

```
36 words = 34 random + 2 checksum = 272 bits of entropy (2²⁷² combinations)
24 words = 22 random + 2 checksum = 176 bits of entropy (2¹⁷⁶ combinations)
```

## Entropy

The system supports two entropy configurations:

<div align="center">

| Configuration | Words | Random + Checksum | Entropy | Combinations | Use Case |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Standard** | 36 | 34 + 2 | 272-bit | ~7.59 × 10⁸¹ | Maximum security — strongest available for cryptocurrency |
| **Compact** | 24 | 22 + 2 | 176-bit | ~9.59 × 10⁵² | High security — sufficient for most applications |

</div>

<br>

**272-bit** exceeds the strongest entropy level used in cryptocurrency. Brute-forcing a 272-bit seed would require more energy than the sun produces in its lifetime. Both configurations use the same 256-position icon set with full positional encoding, and include a 16-bit checksum (2 dedicated words) for error detection.

### Strength Comparison

| System | Effective Security | Brute-Force Resistance |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| RSA 2048 | ~112-bit | Standard key exchange |
| AES-128 | 128-bit | High security baseline |
| Bitcoin (BIP-39, 12 words) | 128-bit | Industry standard for most wallets |
| Bitcoin (BIP-39, 24 words) | 256-bit | Higher security industry standard |
| AES-256 | 256-bit | Military grade |
| **Universal Seed (36 words)** | **272-bit** | **Beyond military grade** |
| **Universal Seed + passphrase** | **272+ bits** | **Second factor expands the keyspace further** |

A 36-word Universal Seed is **2¹⁶⁰ times stronger** than RSA 2048. Adding a passphrase pushes it even further beyond 272 bits.

<br>

## Seed Generation — 8 Independent Entropy Sources

Every generated seed mixes entropy from **8 independent sources** through SHA-512 (a cryptographic randomness extractor). Even if an attacker compromises any combination of sources, the output remains cryptographically strong as long as **any single source** provides real entropy.

<div align="center">

| # | Source | What It Captures | Est. Entropy |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | **`secrets.token_bytes`** | OS CSPRNG (CryptGenRandom / `/dev/urandom`) | 512 bits |
| 2 | **`os.urandom`** | Separate OS CSPRNG call (defense-in-depth) | 512 bits |
| 3 | **`time.perf_counter_ns`** | Hardware timer LSB jitter (nanosecond noise) | ~32 bits |
| 4 | **`os.getpid`** | Process-level uniqueness | ~16 bits |
| 5 | **CPU jitter** | Instruction timing variance (cache/TLB/branch predictor) | ~64 bits |
| 6 | **Thread scheduling** | OS scheduler nondeterminism (4 batches × 8 threads) | ~64 bits |
| 7 | **Hardware RNG** | BCryptGenRandom (Windows) / `/dev/random` (Linux) + ASLR | 512 bits |
| 8 | **Mouse entropy** | User-supplied cursor movement (sub-pixel timing + position) | ~512 bits |

</div>

All sources are combined into a single SHA-512 pool, then a final `secrets.token_bytes` call is folded in to guarantee the output is **at minimum** as strong as the OS CSPRNG alone.

### Entropy Validation — Verified Before Use

Every call to `generate_words()` validates its entropy **before** using it for seed generation. Four statistical tests (based on NIST SP 800-22) are run on every sample:

| Test | What It Catches |
|:---|:---|
| **Monobit** | Bit bias — rejects if 0s and 1s aren't ~50/50 |
| **Chi-squared** | Byte frequency bias — rejects if byte values aren't uniformly distributed |
| **Runs** | Stuck patterns — rejects if bit transitions are predictable |
| **Autocorrelation** | Bit correlations — rejects if bit positions are dependent (Bonferroni-corrected) |

If any test fails, the entropy is **discarded and regenerated** — up to 10 attempts. Only entropy that passes all four tests is ever used. If all 10 attempts fail (indicating a broken or compromised RNG), seed generation raises a `RuntimeError` and refuses to produce a seed.

This means every seed generated by this system is backed by **statistically validated** entropy — not just trusted blindly from the OS.

### Why Multiple Sources?

A single CSPRNG (like `secrets`) is already sufficient for most applications. We go further because:

- **Defense in depth** — if one source has a flaw, the others compensate
- **Hardware diversity** — CPU jitter and thread scheduling capture physical nondeterminism independent from the OS random pool
- **User involvement** — mouse entropy gives users tangible participation in their own security
- **Provable minimum** — the SHA-512 mixing ensures the output has *at least* as much entropy as the best single source

<br>

## Key Derivation Pipeline — 6 Hardening Layers

After generation, the seed is transformed into a 512-bit master key through a **6-layer hardening pipeline**. Each layer addresses a specific attack vector:

```
  Seed (34 × 8-bit icons + 2 checksum) + optional Passphrase
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 0. Checksum Verification │  Verifies the 2 checksum words
    │    & Stripping           │  Then strips them — only data words enter KDF
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 1. Positional Binding    │  Each data icon tagged with its slot index
    │    (pos, icon) pairs     │  Prevents reordering attacks
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 2. Passphrase Mixing     │  Optional second factor
    │                          │  Appended to payload before extraction
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 3. HKDF-Extract          │  HMAC-SHA512 with domain separator
    │    RFC 5869              │  Collapses (seed + passphrase) → PRK
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 4. Chained KDF           │  PBKDF2-SHA512 (600k rounds)
    │    PBKDF2 → Argon2id     │  then Argon2id (64 MiB × 3 iter × 4 lanes)
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 5. HKDF-Expand           │  Domain-separated final derivation
    │    RFC 5869              │  Produces 64 bytes of key material
    └────┬─────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────────────────┐
    │ 512-bit Master Key       │  First 32 bytes: encryption key
    │ (64 bytes)               │  Last 32 bytes: authentication key
    └──────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer 1 — Positional Binding

Each icon is tagged with its **slot position** before hashing:

```
payload = [(pos=0, icon=15), (pos=1, icon=63), (pos=2, icon=136), ...]
```

**Why:** Each icon is cryptographically bound to its exact slot. Position tagging makes the security property **explicit** rather than relying on implicit byte ordering — the position-value relationship is part of the hashed data itself. This is a cryptographic best practice (structured commitment) that ensures `[dog, sun, key]` and `[sun, dog, key]` always produce completely different keys, regardless of how the payload is serialized.

### Layer 2 — Passphrase Mixing

The optional passphrase is UTF-8 encoded and appended to the position-tagged payload **before** extraction. This ensures the passphrase influences every downstream step:

```
payload = [(pos=0, icon=15), (pos=1, icon=63), ...] + passphrase_bytes
```

**Why:** The passphrase acts as a **second factor** (something you *know* in addition to the seed you *have*). By mixing it into the input keying material before HKDF-Extract, it becomes part of the PRK — and therefore affects the chained KDF, HKDF-Expand, and every derived key. Same seed + different passphrase = completely unrelated output. Brute-forcing the passphrase costs ~2 seconds per attempt (full PBKDF2 + Argon2id chain).

### Layer 3 — HKDF-Extract (RFC 5869)

The combined payload (seed + passphrase) is collapsed into a fixed-size **pseudorandom key (PRK)** using HMAC-SHA512 with a domain separator (`universal-seed-v2`):

```
PRK = HMAC-SHA512(key="universal-seed-v2", msg=payload)
```

**Why:** HKDF-Extract is a proven randomness extractor. It takes the variable-length payload (which may have structure — repeating icons, short seeds, passphrase) and produces a uniformly distributed 512-bit key. The domain separator ensures that keys derived by this system can **never collide** with keys from any other system, even if the input data is identical.

### Layer 4 — Chained Key Stretching (PBKDF2 → Argon2id)

The PRK is stretched through **two KDFs in series** — PBKDF2-SHA512 first, then Argon2id on top. Both always run; an attacker must break both to recover the key.

| Parameter | Stage 1: PBKDF2-SHA512 | Stage 2: Argon2id |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Rounds / Iterations** | 600,000 | 3 |
| **Memory** | N/A | 64 MiB per guess |
| **Parallelism** | N/A | 4 lanes |
| **Output** | 64 bytes → fed into Stage 2 | 64 bytes (final) |
| **GPU resistance** | Low | **High** (memory-hard) |
| **ASIC resistance** | Low | **High** (memory-hard) |

```
stage1    = PBKDF2-SHA512(PRK, salt="universal-seed-v2-stretch-pbkdf2", rounds=600000)
stretched = Argon2id(secret=stage1, salt="universal-seed-v2-stretch-argon2id")
```

**Why:** Defense in depth. PBKDF2-SHA512 provides a proven, NIST-approved baseline that resists brute force through sheer iteration count. Argon2id adds memory-hardness on top, making GPU/ASIC parallelization impractical — each attempt requires 64 MiB of RAM. If a vulnerability were ever found in one algorithm, the other still protects the key.

Argon2id is the **winner of the Password Hashing Competition** (2015) and the current OWASP recommendation for high-value targets.

```bash
pip install argon2-cffi   # required
```

### Layer 5 — HKDF-Expand (RFC 5869)

The stretched key is expanded into the final 64-byte master key using HKDF-Expand with a domain-specific info string:

```
master_key = HKDF-Expand(PRK=stretched, info="universal-seed-v2-master", length=64)
```

**Why:** HKDF-Expand provides **domain separation** for the final output. If this system ever needs to derive multiple keys (e.g., encryption key + authentication key), each can use a different info string. The first 32 bytes serve as a 256-bit encryption key, and the last 32 bytes serve as a 256-bit authentication key.

<br>

## Passphrase — Optional Second Factor

The passphrase acts as a **second factor** that makes the derived key dependent on something the user **knows**, in addition to the seed they **have**.

| Scenario | Result |
|:---|:---|
| Same seed, no passphrase | Always produces the same key |
| Same seed + passphrase A | Key X |
| Same seed + passphrase B | Completely unrelated Key Y |
| Different seed + passphrase A | Completely unrelated Key Z |

Key properties:
- The passphrase **only affects the derived key and fingerprint**, not the displayed words/icons
- An empty passphrase is valid and produces a deterministic key
- The passphrase goes through the full PBKDF2 + Argon2id pipeline — brute-forcing is expensive
- Entropy from the passphrase **adds to** the seed entropy (272 + passphrase bits)

### Entropy Estimation

The `get_entropy_bits()` function estimates total security strength:

```python
from seed import get_entropy_bits

get_entropy_bits(36)                    # → 272.0 (seed only)
get_entropy_bits(36, "hunter2")         # → 305.3 (+ passphrase)
get_entropy_bits(36, "Tr0ub4dor&3")    # → 337.2 (mixed case + digits + symbols)
get_entropy_bits(24)                    # → 176.0 (compact seed)
get_entropy_bits(24, "パスワード")       # → 225.2 (+ Unicode passphrase)
```

Passphrase entropy is estimated from the character set used:

| Character Set | Bits per Character |
|:---|:---:|
| Digits only (0-9) | ~3.32 |
| Lowercase only (a-z) | ~4.70 |
| Mixed case (a-z, A-Z) | ~5.70 |
| Mixed + digits | ~5.95 |
| Full printable (+ symbols) | ~6.55 |
| Unicode (non-ASCII) | ~7.00 |

<br>

## Hidden Profiles — Multiple Accounts, One Seed

Hidden profiles let you derive **unlimited independent keys** from a single master key using profile passwords. Each profile password produces a completely unrelated key — and without the password, no one can detect that the profile exists.

```
Seed → Master Key (expensive KDF — runs once)
  ├── default (no password) = master key
  ├── "personal"  → independent 64-byte key
  ├── "business"  → independent 64-byte key
  └── "savings"   → independent 64-byte key
```

```python
from seed import get_private_key, get_profile

master = get_private_key(seed)

personal = get_profile(master, "personal")    # independent key
business = get_profile(master, "business")    # completely unrelated
savings  = get_profile(master, "savings")     # each password = new account
default  = get_profile(master, "")            # empty = master key itself
```

| Property | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Algorithm | HMAC-SHA512(master_key, domain + password) |
| Speed | Instant — single HMAC, no KDF (master key is already hardened) |
| Deterministic | Same password always produces the same key |
| Independent | Profiles cannot be derived from each other |
| Hidden | No way to enumerate how many profiles exist |
| Plausible deniability | Under duress, reveal only the default profile |

**Why this matters:** With BIP-39, one seed = one wallet. To manage multiple accounts you need multiple seeds. With the Universal Seed System, one seed + profile passwords = unlimited independent wallets, all hidden behind a single backup.

## Using seed.py in Python

Everything lives in a single file — `seed.py`. Import it and you get seed generation, key derivation, word lookup, and entropy estimation.

### Installation

```bash
pip install argon2-cffi   # required — used in the chained KDF pipeline
```

No other dependencies required. `seed.py` uses only Python standard library plus `argon2-cffi`.

### Quick Start

```python
from seed import generate_words, get_private_key, get_fingerprint, get_entropy_bits, get_languages, verify_checksum

# Generate a 36-word seed (272-bit entropy, 34 random + 2 checksum)
seed = generate_words(36)
# → [(15, "dog"), (63, "sun"), (136, "key"), ..., (cs1, "word"), (cs2, "word")]

# Generate in a specific language
seed = generate_words(36, language="french")
# → [(15, "chien"), (63, "soleil"), (136, "clé"), ...]

# List available languages
get_languages()
# → [("english", "English"), ("arabic", "العربية"), ("french", "Français"), ...]

# Derive a key — pass the seed directly
key = get_private_key(seed)                # 64 bytes
fp  = get_fingerprint(seed)                # "A3F1B2C4"

# Verify checksum (last 2 words)
verify_checksum(seed)                      # True

# With a passphrase (second factor — same seed, different passphrase = different key)
key = get_private_key(seed, "my secret passphrase")

# Hidden profiles — multiple accounts from one seed
from seed import get_profile
personal = get_profile(key, "personal")       # independent 64-byte key
business = get_profile(key, "business")       # completely unrelated key

# Also accepts plain words or raw indexes (must be 24 or 36 with valid checksum)
words = [w for _, w in seed]          # extract word strings
key = get_private_key(words)          # resolve words → indexes → key
key = get_private_key([i for i, _ in seed])  # raw indexes work too

# Estimate total entropy
bits = get_entropy_bits(36, "my secret passphrase")
# → 383.8 (272 seed + 111.8 passphrase)
```

### Word Resolution

```python
from seed import resolve, search

# Resolve any word in any of 42 languages → icon index
resolve("dog")       # → 15
resolve("perro")     # → 15  (Spanish)
resolve("犬")        # → 15  (Japanese)
resolve("🐕")        # → 15  (emoji)
resolve("corazón")   # → 8   (with accent)
resolve("corazon")   # → 8   (without accent — same result)
resolve("собака")    # → 15  (Russian)
resolve("unknown")   # → None

# Autocomplete suggestions
search("do")
# → [("doctor", 211), ("dog", 15), ("dolphin", 54), ("door", 158)]

# Resolve a full seed phrase at once (pass a list)
indexes, errors = resolve(["dog", "sun", "key", "heart"])
# indexes = [15, 63, 136, 8], errors = []
```

### Mouse Entropy

```python
from seed import mouse_entropy, generate_words

# Create an entropy pool
pool = mouse_entropy()

# Feed mouse movements (call on each mouse move event)
pool.add_sample(x=412, y=308)   # → True (new position)
pool.add_sample(x=412, y=308)   # → False (duplicate, skipped)
pool.add_sample(x=415, y=310)   # → True

# Check progress
pool.bits_collected   # → 4 (2 bits per unique sample)
pool.sample_count     # → 2

# Extract and use
extra = pool.digest()                        # 64 bytes of entropy
seed = generate_words(36, extra_entropy=extra)  # mixed into generation
```

### Randomness Verification

Verify that the entropy source is producing high-quality randomness before trusting it for seed generation:

```python
from seed import verify_randomness

result = verify_randomness()

# Check overall result
if not result["pass"]:
    raise RuntimeError("Weak randomness detected!")

# Iterate individual tests
for test in result["tests"]:
    status = "PASS" if test["pass"] else "FAIL"
    print(f"{test['test']}: {status}")
```

Four statistical tests based on NIST SP 800-22:

| Test | What It Detects |
|:---|:---|
| **Monobit** | Bit bias — 0s and 1s should be ~50/50 |
| **Chi-squared** | Byte frequency bias — all 256 values should appear uniformly |
| **Runs** | Stuck patterns — bit transitions should be random |
| **Autocorrelation** | Bit correlations — each bit position should be independent |

The test app (`examples/universal.py`) includes a `RandomnessDialog` window that runs these tests with a progress bar and displays checkmarks for each passing test.

### KDF Backend Info

```python
from seed import kdf_info

print(kdf_info())
# → "PBKDF2-SHA512 (600,000 rounds) + Argon2id (mem=65536KB, t=3, p=4)"
```

## Word Lookup System

All 42 language word lists plus emoji characters are compiled into a single file (`words.json`) containing a flat hash table for **instant** word resolution and embedded language maps for generation in any language. Everything is in one file — `seed.py`.

<br>

### Capabilities

| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Emoji input** | Typing or pasting an emoji (e.g. :muscle: :dog2: :sunny:) resolves directly to its visual index |
| **NFKC normalization** | Full-width characters, ligatures, and composed forms unified automatically |
| **Zero-width removal** | ZWJ, ZWNJ, soft hyphens, BOM, and invisible characters stripped |
| **Case insensitive** | All lookups are lowercase-normalized |
| **Prefix search** | Built-in `search()` for autocomplete / search UI |

<br>

### Diacritic-Insensitive Matching

Smart per-script handling — marks are only stripped where it's safe:

| Script | Behavior | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Latin** | Accents removed | `corazón` → `corazon`, `ß` → `ss`, `ø` → `o`, `æ` → `ae` |
| **Greek** | Tonos removed | `σκύλος` → `σκυλος` |
| **Arabic** | Tashkeel removed | Vowel marks (harakat) are optional |
| **Hebrew** | Niqqud removed | Vowel points are optional |
| **Cyrillic** | ё → е | Common Russian substitution |
| **Thai, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gurmukhi** | **Preserved** | Marks change meaning — never stripped |

<br>

### Performance

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Import / JSON load** | ~99 ms | One-time at startup (38,730 keys) |
| **Generate 36 words** | ~9 ms | Full 8-source entropy collection + checksum |
| **Generate 24 words** | ~5 ms | Full 8-source entropy collection + checksum |
| **Key derivation** | ~2 sec | PBKDF2 (600k rounds) + Argon2id (64 MiB) |
| **Word resolve** | ~0.01 ms | O(1) hash table lookup |
| **Prefix search** | ~0.04 ms | Binary search + dedup |
| **36-word seed resolve** | ~0.3 ms | 36 × resolve |
| **Fingerprint (no passphrase)** | <0.01 ms | HMAC only |
| **Fingerprint (with passphrase)** | ~2 sec | Full chained KDF pipeline |

### Word Coverage

| Stat | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Total lookup keys | **38,730** across 42 languages + emoji |
| Avg words per position | **3.5** |
| Max word length (shortest per index) | **7 chars** across all languages |
| Languages with 0 single-word indexes | **36** of 42 |
| Cross-language collisions | **0** |
| File size (words.json) | **783 KB** |

<br>

## Example

A user generates a seed and sees:

```
Position 1:  🐕  dog
Position 2:  ☀️  sun
Position 3:  🔑  key
         ...
```

They write their backup on paper — in any language, using any accepted word, or even a personal synonym that reminds them of the visual:

| Approach | Backup | Why it works |
|:---|:---|:---|
| :gb: English | `dog  sun  key  ...` | Direct base words |
| :es: Spanish | `perro  sol  llave  ...` | Native language |
| :jp: Japanese | `犬  太陽  鍵  ...` | Any supported script |
| Mixed | `dog  soleil  key  ...` | Languages can be combined freely |
| Personal hints | `puppy  bright  lock  ...` | Any accepted synonym — write what makes sense to you |

To recover, they type what they wrote — in any language — and the system maps each word back to its visual position. Alternatively, they can select the **36 icons directly**, bypassing language entirely.

<br>

## Running the Test

A test app is included for trying out seed generation and recovery.

```bash
pip install PySide6
pip install argon2-cffi   # required for key derivation
python examples/universal.py
```

<br>

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially for improving word coverage across languages. Adding more synonyms, shorter alternatives, regional variants, and colloquial terms for each visual position would be very appreciated.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute, the file format, and guidelines for adding words.
